What is an Amazon Free Code Generator?
An Amazon Free Code Generator is a tool or website that supposedly provides users with free Amazon gift card codes without requiring any payment. These generators claim to generate valid Amazon codes that can be redeemed for store credit, allowing users to shop for free.

Are Amazon Free Code Generators Legitimate?
The short answer is no. Amazon does not support or authorize any free code generators. All legitimate Amazon gift cards come directly from Amazon itself, authorized retailers, or official promotions. Websites or apps promising to generate free gift card codes are usually scams designed to:

Steal your personal information
Infect your device with malware or viruses
Trick you into completing surveys or downloading apps for no actual reward
Gain access to your Amazon account
Amazon has a highly secure system that prevents fake or randomly generated codes from being used. If a generator claims to bypass Amazonâ€™s security, it is most likely a fraudulent scheme.

How to Get Free Amazon Gift Cards Safely in 2025
While free code generators are fake, there are legitimate ways to earn free Amazon gift cards:

Amazon Giveaways & Promotions: Amazon frequently hosts official promotions where you can win gift cards.
Microsoft Rewards: Earn points through Microsoft Rewards and redeem them for Amazon gift cards.
Survey Websites: Sites like Swagbucks, InboxDollars, and MyPoints allow you to complete surveys and earn gift cards.
Cashback & Reward Apps: Apps like Ibotta, Rakuten, and Honey offer cashback or points that can be redeemed for Amazon credit.
Trade-In Program: Amazonâ€™s Trade-In Program allows you to exchange old electronics and books for Amazon gift cards.
How to Spot Scams and Stay Safe
To avoid falling for scams, follow these guidelines:

Never enter your Amazon login details on suspicious websites. Amazon will never ask for your password outside of its official site.
Avoid websites that ask for personal information in exchange for gift card codes.
Do not download unknown software or apps that claim to generate free Amazon codes.
Only trust official sources like Amazonâ€™s website and verified retailers for gift card promotions.
